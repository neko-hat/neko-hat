    "title": "Release v0.4.0",
    "content": "We’re so excited to release Just the Docs v0.4.0. This release has been almost a year in the making - after our new maintenance team has taken over the project, we’ve added two years of backlogged features and bugfixes to modernize the theme. This CHANGELOG will summarize some of the key changes, discuss migrations strategies, and outline broad future plans for this theme. Brief Overview - Highlighted Changes . v0.4.0 contains many new features and bugfixes. We enumerate all of them in further sections in this changelog; however, we’d like to call out some of the most-requested changes: . | better support for dark theme: dark highlighting, search input color | callouts, a new design component to highlight content | configuring mermaid.js, a markdown-native diagram visualization library | copy code button for code snippets | external navigation links | major improvements to nav generation efficiency and robustness | minor improvements to built-in accessibility (SVG icons, nav titles, skip to main content) | modularized site components (advanced feature) | new custom includes: table of contents heading, navigation panel footer, search placeholder, lunr search indices | bugfixes involving WEBrick and Ruby 3, Liquid processing in CSS comments, nested task lists, relative URLs, scroll navigation, corrupted search data from rake, breadcrumbs, and more! | more documentation for custom includes, this changelog, and the migration guide | . After usage instructions and the roadmap, we enumerate all changes from v0.3.3. Using Release v0.4.0 . Unlike pre-releases, v0.4.0 is a new semver minor release for the theme. That means that users who have not pinned the theme version will be automatically upgraded to v0.4.0 the next time they build their site. To use this release explicitly as a remote theme: . remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.4.0 . To use this RC explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your Gemfile and re-run bundle install or bundle update just-the-docs: . gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.4.0\" . If you would prefer to not upgrade, you can enforce that explicitly: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Migration Guide and Strategies . We’ve developed a new migration guide for users to migrate from version v0.3.3 to v0.4.0. It outlines major changes in project maintenance (e.g. new repository link, team) as well as breaking changes that may break your site (and potential solutions). We suggest that all users refer to the guide before manually upgrading their site. For the vast majority of users, we do not anticipate that this will be a breaking change. The major touch points are surrounding new includes, navigation (ordering, pages, and collections), the favicon, and a shift to relative URLs. However, users who heavily customize the theme (primarily by overriding includes) will likely have to make minor changes. Given the length of features added in this release, users may want to incrementally upgrade through the pre-releases. To follow this approach, read this changelog from v0.4.0.rc1 to v0.4.0.rc5; this breaks down the release into small chunks, each of which should be easier to upgrade. v0.4.0.rc5 is identical to this release. For support with migrating to v0.4.0, open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Roadmap (What’s Next?) . Moving forward, we plan to release more frequently with smaller, bite-sized changes. This should make it easier for users to upgrade in the future! . Broadly, many features are still on the radar. We anticipate the rest of v0.4.x to be bugfixes surrounding this new release. For version v0.5, our roadmap includes: . | a theme toggle (light/dark mode), with automatic theme switching based on browser preferences | better GDPR compliance for analytics | multi-level/recursive navigation (unlimited hierarchy of child pages) | . In future versions, we also plan on: . | adding better dark theme defaults | adding better internationalization support | exploring offline PDF generation | improving accessibility within the theme | improving search functionality | refactoring and improving the robustness of our codebase | . Have ideas for what’s next, or want to get involved? Open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! We’re looking for more contributors and maintainers to help us develop the theme.

In general, this is a more mature pre-release; there are few new features. However, we’ll highlight @pdmosses’s work in #992 to better optimize nav generation for large sites (ex 100+ pages). We don’t expect this to affect most users; however, it is technically a breaking change, and we suggest testing your site before upgrading to this prerelease. We want your feedback! Please open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . As soon as we get stable test results from major downstream users, we’ll push out a v0.4.0 ASAP - closing out almost 2 years of backlogged work! . Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc3 .

    "content": "We’re back! . Hi all! The Just the Docs team is excited to have our first pre-release in over two years! It is jam-packed with features and bugfixes that have been requested by the community since 2020. They include: . | The new callouts component | Allowing pages and collections to coexist on the navigation pane | New styling: dark syntax highlighting, support for jekyll-asciidoc, word-wrapping instead of overflow for various elements | More customization: external nav links, custom nav footers, favicon includes, search color and placeholder configuration, mermaid.js support, and nav sorting | Over 20 bugfixes! Big ones include fixing the rake command, using relative_url, and search input color | More documentation, especially on using custom includes | Updating core dependencies to stable Ruby versions | A WIP template repository that allows you to setup your own repository using Just the Docs and GitHub Pages with one click - give it a shot! More documentation, etc. is on the way! | . We want your feedback! Are these changes helpful? Are our docs easy to understand? Should new features like mermaid be opt-in or opt-out? Please open an issue or start a discussion and let us know! . Trying out pre-release v0.4.0.rc1 . Due to the massive scope of these changes, we’re making v0.4.0.rc1 avaialble as a release candidate for the theme (i.e., a pre-release) with release v0.4.0 coming soon. We want your help in testing the changes! As of now, the gem on RubyGems and the repository are updated to v0.4.0.rc1.

If you’re not ready to make the switch, that’s alright! If your version of just-the-docs is pinned to v0.3.3 (i.e. by a Gemfile.lock or in remote_theme, then there’s nothing you need to do. If you have not pinned your theme version, you should either: . | pin your gem version in your Gemfile, like so gem \"just-the-docs\", \"0.3.3\" . | freeze the remote_theme, like so remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.3.3 . | . Use of branches for closed PRs (e.g., #466, #578) is now deprecated, as those branches have been (directly or indirectly) merged, and they may be deleted after the pre-release of v0.4.0.rc1. Maintenance . Internally, our maintainer team has expanded: Patrick Marsceill, the original maintainer, has stepped down from an active role after almost 4 years! We’re very thankful for the work that he’s done to create and maintain one of the most popular Jekyll themes. Please join us in giving him thanks! . The new core team currently consists of @mattxwang, @pdmosses, @skullface, @dougaitken, and @max06. Over the past six months, we’ve been triaging and merging in PRs, as well as contributing our own fixes. We’ll continue to address open issues, merge in PRs from the community, and plan out the future of Just the Docs. If you’d like to contribute, now is a great time! . Roadmap . In the short-term, we’re committed to tidying up everything for a v0.4.0 release. This involves fixing bugs reported from the community in this pre-release, as well as continually merging in minor PRs. We’re also scoping out medium and long-term projects, and want to keep you in the loop. These include: . | upgrading to Jekyll 4, and stopping support for Jekyll 3 | versioned docs - issue #728 | improved accessibility - issues #566, #870 | internationalization (i18n) - issue #59 | recursive/multi-level navigation - PR #462 | toggleable dark mode - issue #234 | . as well as DX improvements like better regression tests, CI, and tooling.

    "content": "REPOSITORY CHANGES . Just the Docs . The theme repo is now at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs. The name of its default branch is now main. The theme docs website is now published at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs. GitHub provides access to previous versions of the theme repo. You can browse previous versions of the theme docs website on the Internet Archive. The README page on the theme repo repeats much of the information from the home page, formatted for browsing on GitHub. It also explains how to install the theme as a Ruby Gem, without creating a new site. Deploy previews . When a PR builds successfully, Netlify provides a preview of how the theme docs website will look if the PR is merged. You can find links to the preview near the bottom of the Conversation tab of the PR. Just the Docs Template . The template at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template creates a repo with the minimal source files for a Just the Docs website. After configuring the relevant parameters, you can build and serve the website both locally and on GitHub Pages – using either Jekyll 3 or Jekyll 4! . Just the Docs Tests . The tests website at https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs-tests consists mainly of regression tests for bug fixes and new features. The test source files at https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-tests illustrate the use of many Markdown and Jekyll features, including some that are not included in the theme docs. For example, see how to add support for rendering TeX/LaTeX math formulas with KaTeX and MathJax. POTENTIALLY-BREAKING CHANGES in v0.4.0 . If switching to a new release of the theme breaks your website, check that you don’t have any files in the _includes, _layouts, and _sass directories with the same names as files provided by the theme. If your repo has a customised copy of _layouts/default.html from a previous release, try removing it, or replace it by a fresh copy of the theme file. The following changes made in v0.4.0 might break or adversely affect your website when you next rebuild it, unless you have pinned it! . New includes and SCSS . Version 0.4.0 introduces many new _includes files. If you already have an existing include with the same name as a new addition, you will need to migrate or update that include. The new files are (relative to the _includes folder): . | mermaid_config.js | nav_footer_custom | search_placeholder_custom | toc_heading_custom | the entire components/ folder: . | aux_nav, breadcrumbs, children_nav, footer, header, mermaid, search_footer, search_header, sidebar | . | the entire icons/ folder . | code_copy, document, expand, external_link, icons, link, menu, search | . | the entire lunr/ folder . | custom-data.json, custom-index.js | . | . We have removed some code in _sass/vendor and added a new file at _sass/custom/setup.scss. favicons . The file _includes/favicon.html is now ignored by the theme. If you’re using it, your website’s favicon is no longer displayed by browsers. To fix: Move the content of _includes/favicon.html to _includes/head_custom.html. Custom callout colors . The file _sass/custom/custom.scss is now imported last: after the configuration of callouts. If you’ve defined custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss (and used them when configuring your callouts in _config.yml) you will not be able to rebuild your website. To fix: Move custom color variables for callouts in _sass/custom/custom.scss to _sass/custom/variables.scss. Pages and collections . Links to ordinary pages now appear in the navigation on sites that use collections. You might want the navigation of your site to consist entirely of collections. To fix: Add the front matter nav_exclude: true to pages that the navigation should not display. Relative URLs . All generated URLs are now relative. This is a bug fix, and unlikely to break any site. Relative links to pages within a website support deployment to different servers. Navigation order . The order in which the navigation panel lists pages has been simplified. All pages with nav_order values now come before all pages that are ordered by title. If your website has a group of sibling pages where some siblings have nav_order string values, and others are ordered by numerical title values, the former now come before the latter. To fix: Add numerical nav_order values to the pages with numerical title values. DEPRECATIONS . The following features are deprecated, and to be removed in a future release. Jekyll 3 . You can still use Jekyll 3 (3.8.5 or later) to build websites using v0.4.0 of the theme. However, future releases of the theme may require the use of Jekyll 4. You can already use Jekyll 4 to build your website locally. It should look exactly the same as when built with Jekyll 3.1 . To use Jekyll 4 when building your website on GitHub Pages, you need to run GitHub Actions. The simplest way of setting that up in a new repo is to create the repo using the Just the Docs template. To start running Jekyll 4 to build an existing repo on GitHub Pages, you can create a new repo with the template, then copy its .github/workflows directory, and update your repo settings to use Actions. Footer content configuration . Currently, if your configuration sets footer_content to some text, the theme displays that text at the bottom of the main section of each page. The file _includes/footer_custom.html provides a more general way of customizing not only the text but also the markup for the page footer area. You can replicate the current display of TEXT in the footer using the following markup: . &lt;p class=\"text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0\"&gt;TEXT&lt;/p&gt; . THEME WEBSITE CHANGES . The website now uses callouts2 to draw attention to important information. The theme uses semantic versioning. A normal version number takes the form X.Y.Z, where X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. The theme uses version X.Y.Z.rcN for pre-release N of version X.Y.Z. When referring to version numbers on GitHub, we usually prefix them by ‘v’. Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, where anything may change at any time. In practice, we increment the patch version Z for bug fixes and backwards compatible changes; we increment the minor version Y for changes that could break websites using the theme without pinning it to a specific version. The label NEW in the theme website indicates a feature that has been changed or added since the release of the previous minor version. For example, after the release of v0.4.Z, the theme website should label NEW all features that we have changed or added since v0.3.0 – not just since v0.3.3. When we release v0.5.0, we will remove all those labels, and add labels on features since v0.4.0. The theme docs website is not itself versioned. It changes incrementally, independently of theme releases. Home page . The theme home page now focuses on the simplest ways of using the theme. It also notes the different behaviour of theme and remote_theme in connection with interim versions of the theme, such as pre-releases. CHANGELOG . The CHANGELOG page lists the changes made in all previous releases and pre-releases of new versions of the theme gem. It also lists changes made to the main branch of the theme since the latest release or pre-release. For changes since v0.3.3, the log usually references the merged PR that made the change and its author. NON-BREAKING CHANGES (OUTLINE ONLY) . Accessibility . | Skip to main content: the first keyboard-navigatable item is now a link to skip over the sidebar and header to the main content of the page. PR: #949. | Aria-labels: improved aria-labels have been added to various site elements. PRs: #950, … | Other general improvements: gradual changes have improved tab focusability, contrast, and semantic elements. More work still to come. PRs: #498, #846 | . Configuration . | Mermaid support: first-class support for Mermaid - a JavaScript-based diagram and charting tool supported by GitHub - has been added to the theme. This feature is opt-in. See the new doc subsections in Configuration and Code for more. | Multiple Google Analytics tags are now supported. PR: #1029 | . Customization . | all user-facing text is now customizable; previously, several elements (ex search placeholder) were hardwired into the theme. Now, users can blend custom includes and layouts to internationalize their sites. | we’ve clarified the role of custom.scss to be imported last; to allow users to define custom or override variables, we’ve added a new file setup.scss. PR: #1135 | . Custom Includes . We’ve added several custom _includes to provide users with more customization options for different site elements. We’ve also added a section to Configuration to outline these. All of these are opt-in by default; however, these may be breaking if you have existing _includes with the same name. Each item is listed with the relevant file and PR. | TOC heading: toc_heading_custom.html, PR: #980 | Navigation panel footer: nav_footer_custom.html, PR: #474 | Search placeholder: search_placeholder_custom.html, PR: #613 | Modular site components: components/ and icons/, PR: [#1058] | Custom search indices: lunr/, PR: #1068 | . In a future (version 1) release, we may rename the custom include files. Modular Components . We’ve broken up the default layout (_layouts/default.html) into multiple reusable components. This should have no impact on most users; however, it should make it easier to implement custom layouts. For more, see Custom layouts and includes. PR: [#1058]. Navigation . | Collections: nav panel shows links to ordinary pages before collections | Collection folding; part of “Combination”. PR: #578 | Scrolling to show link to selected page. PR: #639 | External nav links are now supported. PR: #876 | Child nav order: sort navigation pages with child_nav_order. PR: #726 | Order when mixing different ways of specifying nav order | . Search . In addition to customizing the search placeholder, we’ve also added the ability to provide custom content to the search index. for more, see Custom content for search index. PR: #1068. Styling . | Code copying: code blocks now allow users to easily copy their contents. PR: #945 | Blockquote: shows vertical bar on left. PR: #965 | Links wrap. PR: #905 | Callouts: a new component similar to alerts or banners. See UI Components - Callouts. PR: #466 | . | Jekyll 4 depends on more recent versions of other gems than Jekyll 3, and the differences between those versions may affect the files of your built site. &#8617; . | The theme website configuration defines the callout titles and colors used there.

    "content": "New (v0.4.0) . Mermaid allows you to add diagrams and visualizations using Markdown code blocks. It is disabled by default. However, you can turn on support for mermaid by adding a mermaid key to your _config.yml. The minimum configuration requires a version key (matching a version in jsDelivr): . mermaid: # Version of mermaid library # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/ version: \"9.1.3\" . Additional configuration options are loaded through _includes/mermaid_config.js. By default, the contents of the file are the empty object: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js {} . This loads the default settings. The contents of this object should follow mermaid’s configuration API. For example, to override the theme, change _includes/mermaid_config.js to: . // _includes/mermaid_config.js { theme: \"forest\" } . Once mermaid is installed, it can be used in markdown files. The markdown for a simple flowchart example might look like the following: . ```mermaid graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; ``` . which renders: . graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; . Note: for demonstration purposes, we’ve enabled mermaid on this site. It is still disabled by default, and users need to opt-in to use it. Using a local mermaid library . In order to use a local version of the mermaid library instead of one provided by jsDelivr, you can specify a path key in the mermaid configuration instead of a version key. mermaid: # To load mermaid from a local file use the `path` key to specify the location of the library instead; e.g. path: \"/assets/js/mermaid.min.js\" . Using mermaid with AsciiDoc . Users of AsciiDoc (e.g. via jekyll-asciidoc) may need additional configuration to use mermaid. By default, AsciiDoc generates HTML markup that mermaid cannot properly parse. The simplest way to resolve this is to use a passthrough block: . ++++ &lt;pre class=\"language-mermaid\"&gt; graph TD; A--&gt;B; A--&gt;C; B--&gt;D; C--&gt;D; &lt;/pre&gt; ++++ . Alternatively, community member @flyx has contributed a Ruby extension that does not require extra markup. The extension is available as a GitHub Gist. Thank you to @flyx! . The asciidoctor-diagram extension which also supports mermaid is not recommended for use with Just the Docs, since it requires separate configuration e.g. for theming, and is known to not be trivial to set up.

If you want to add a scheme named foo (can be any name) just add a file _sass/color_schemes/foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) where you override theme variables to change colors, fonts, spacing, etc. Since the default color scheme is light, your custom scheme is implicitly based on the variable settings used by the light scheme. If you want your custom scheme to be based on the dark scheme, you need to start your file with the following line: . @import \"./color_schemes/dark\"; . You can define custom schemes based on other custom schemes in the same way. Available variables are listed in the _variables.scss file. For example, to change the link color from the purple default to blue, include the following inside your scheme file: . Example . $link-color: $blue-000; . Keep in mind that changing a variable will not automatically change the value of other variables that depend on it. For example, the default link color ($link-color) is set to $purple-000. However, redefining $purple-000 in a custom color scheme will not automatically change $link-color to match it. Instead, each variable that relies on previously-cascaded values must be manually reimplemented by copying the dependent rules from _variables.scss — in this case, rewriting $link-color: $purple-000;. Note: Editing the variables directly in _sass/support/variables.scss is not recommended and can cause other dependencies to fail. Please use scheme files. Use a custom scheme . To use the custom color scheme, only set the color_scheme parameter in your site’s _config.yml file: . color_scheme: foo . Switchable custom scheme . If you want to be able to change the scheme dynamically, for example via javascript, just add a file assets/css/just-the-docs-foo.scss (replace foo by your scheme name) with the following content: . --- --- {% include css/just-the-docs.scss.liquid color_scheme=\"foo\" %} .

To change the default TOC heading to “Contents”, create _includes/toc_heading_custom.html and add: . &lt;h2 class=\"text-delta\"&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt; . The (optional) text-delta class makes the heading appear as Contents . Custom Footer . _includes/footer_custom.html . This content appears at the bottom of every page’s main content. More info for this include can be found in the Configuration - Footer content. Custom Head . _includes/head_custom.html . Any HTML added to this file will be inserted before the closing &lt;head&gt; tag. This might include additional &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, or &lt;script&gt; tags.

To briefly summarize each component: . | _includes/head.html is the entire &lt;head&gt; tag for the site; this imports stylesheets, various JavaScript files (ex: analytics, mermaid, search, and Just the Docs code), and SEO / meta information. | _includes/icons/icons.html imports all SVG icons that are used throughout the site. Some, such as those relating to search or code snippet copying, are only loaded when those features are enabled. | _includes/components/sidebar.html renders the sidebar, containing the site header, navigation links, external links, collections, and nav footer. | _includes/components/header.html renders the navigation header, containing the search bar, custom header, and aux links | _includes/components/breadcrumbs.html renders the breadcrumbs feature | vendor/anchor_headings.html is a local copy of Vladimir Jimenez’s jekyll-anchor-headings snippet | _includes/components/children_nav.html renders a list of nav links to child pages on parent pages | _includes/components/footer.html renders the bottom-of-page footer | _includes/components/search_footer.html renders DOM elements that are necessary for the search bar to work | _includes/components/mermaid.html initializes mermaid if the feature is enabled | . Each of these components can be overridden individually using the same process described in the Override includes section. In particular, the granularity of components should allow users to replace certain components (such as the sidebar) without having to adjust the rest of the code. Future versions may subdivide components further; we guarantee that we will only place them in folders (ex components/, icons/, or a new js/) to avoid top-level namespace collisions. Alternative layouts and example (minimal) . Users can develop custom layouts that compose, omit, or add components differently. We provide one first-class example titled minimal, inspired by Kevin Lin’s work in just-the-class. This minimal layout does not render the sidebar, header, or search. To see an example, visit the minimal layout test page. Here is a simplified code example of what it looks like: . &lt;!-- a simplified version of _layouts/minimal.html --&gt; &lt;html&gt; {% include head.html %} &lt;body&gt; {% include icons/icons.html %} {% comment %} Bandaid fix for breadcrumbs here! {% endcomment %} {% include components/breadcrumbs.html %} {% if site.heading_anchors != false %} {% include vendor/anchor_headings.html html=content ... %} {% else %} {{ content }} {% endif %} {% if page.has_children == true and page.has_toc != false %} {% include components/children_nav.html %} {% endif %} {% include components/footer.html %} {% if site.mermaid %} {% include components/mermaid.html %} {% endif %} &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . This layout is packaged in Just the Docs. Users can indicate this alternative layout in page front matter: . --- layout: minimal title: Minimal layout test --- . Similarly, users and developers can create other alternative layouts using Just the Docs’ reusable includable components. Default layout and inheritance chain . Under the hood, . | default and minimal inherit from the table_wrappers layout, which wraps all HTML &lt;table&gt; tags with a div .table-wrapper | table_wrappers inherits from vendor/compress, which is a local copy of Anatol Broder’s jekyll-compress-html Jekyll plugin | . Note that as of now, minimal and default have no inheritance relationship. Overridden default Jekyll layouts . By default, Jekyll (and its default theme minima) provide the about, home, page, and post layouts. In Just the Docs, we override all of these layouts with the default layout. Each of those layouts is simply: . --- layout: default --- {{ content }} . ",

You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs. You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on GitHub Pages – the template README file explains how to do that, along with other details. If Jekyll is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site locally. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.2 And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. More specifically, the created site: . | uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a Gemfile and loads the just-the-docs gem | uses the GitHub Pages / Actions workflow to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages | . Other than that, you’re free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of just-the-docs and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins. See the theme README for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site. ",

All pages with explicit nav_order parameters come before all pages ordered by their title values. By default, all Capital letters come before all lowercase letters; you can add nav_sort: case_insensitive in the configuration file to ignore the case. Enclosing strings in (single or double) quotation marks is optional. Numeric values are not enclosed in quotation marks, e.g., 42, -1.0; numbers in quotation marks are lexicographically ordered, so \"10\" comes before \"2\", for example. ",

    "title": "Pages with children",
    "content": "Sometimes you will want to create a page with many children (a section). First, it is recommended that you keep pages that are related in a directory together… For example, in these docs, we keep all of the written documentation in the ./docs directory and each of the sections in subdirectories like ./docs/ui-components and ./docs/utilities. This gives us an organization like: . +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) |-- docs |-- ui-components | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- buttons.md | |-- code.md | |-- labels.md | |-- tables.md | +-- typography.md | |-- utilities | |-- index.md (parent page) | |-- color.md | |-- layout.md | |-- responsive-modifiers.md | +-- typography.md | |-- (other md files, pages with no children) | +-- .. |-- (Jekyll files) +-- .. On the parent pages, add this YAML front matter parameter: . | has_children: true (tells us that this is a parent page) | . Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . Here we’re setting up the UI Components landing page that is available at /docs/ui-components, which has children and is ordered second in the main nav. Child pages . On child pages, simply set the parent: YAML front matter to whatever the parent’s page title is and set a nav order (this number is now scoped within the section). Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 --- . The Buttons page appears as a child of UI Components and appears second in the UI Components section. Ordering child pages . New (v0.4.0) . You can optionally add the following to the YAML front matter to reverse the default sort order of child pages: . | child_nav_order: reversed | . Example . --- layout: default title: Reversed Child Pages child_nav_order: reversed --- . Auto-generating Table of Contents . By default, all pages with children will automatically append a Table of Contents which lists the child pages after the parent page’s content. To disable this auto Table of Contents, set has_toc: false in the parent page’s YAML front matter. Example . --- layout: default title: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true has_toc: false --- . Children with children . Child pages can also have children (grandchildren). This is achieved by using a similar pattern on the child and grandchild pages. | Add the has_children attribute to the child | Add the parent and grand_parent attribute to the grandchild | . Example . --- layout: default title: Buttons parent: UI Components nav_order: 2 has_children: true --- . --- layout: default title: Buttons Child Page parent: Buttons grand_parent: UI Components nav_order: 1 --- . This would create the following navigation structure: . +-- .. |-- UI Components |-- .. | |-- Buttons | |-- Button Child Page | |-- .. | +-- .. Currently, the navigation structure is limited to 3 levels: grandchild pages cannot themselves have child pages. ",
